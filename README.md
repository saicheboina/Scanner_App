## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (Dart >= 3.2.5)
- **Packages**: `flutter_barcode_scanner`, `provider`, `shared_preferences`, `csv`, `path_provider`, `share`, `http`, `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `google_sign_in`, `flutter_svg`, `sign_in_button`
- **Firebase** (Auth)

> See `pubspec.yaml` for exact versions.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Flutter (stable) 3.x installed & configured
- A Firebase project with **Authentication** enabled
  - Providers: **Email/Password** and **Google**
- Platform SDKs as needed (Android Studio / Xcode, etc.)

---

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone & fetch packages**
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>.git
   cd <repo>
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase** (per platform)

   - **Android**
     - Place your `android/app/google-services.json`.
     - Confirm `classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.1'` in `android/build.gradle` and `apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'` in `android/app/build.gradle` (already present).
     - Package name: `ml.sivasai.inventory_scanner` (change if you rename).

   - **iOS / macOS**
     - Place `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` and `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (if using macOS).
     - In **Xcode** add URL Types with **REVERSED_CLIENT_ID** from the plist for Google Sign‑In.

   - **Web**
     - If using `flutterfire configure`, ensure `firebase_options.dart` includes Web config.

3. **Permissions**
   - **Camera** is required for scanning.
     - Android: most camera permissions are handled by the scanner plugin; ensure minSdk/targets are compatible.
     - iOS: add camera usage description to `Info.plist` if not present:
       ```xml
       <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
       <string>We use the camera to scan barcodes.</string>
       ```

4. **Run**
   ```bash
   # Choose a device or emulator first
   flutter run
   ```

---

## ▶️ How to Use

1. **Sign In** with Email/Password or **Continue with Google**.
2. Open **Scan** (Camera) to scan a product barcode/QR.
3. Review the **List**; tap an item for **Details**.
4. Use **Export** to generate a **CSV** and **Share** it.
